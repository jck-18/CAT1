"""Network configuration for the assessment.

This is the ONE place network specifics live. No IP address, subnet, adapter
name or tool path should appear anywhere else in the repo - every phase script
imports what it needs from here.

Fill in the "EDIT ME" block below on day one (see shared/SETUP.md), commit it,
and the rest of the repo just works.

Anything here can also be overridden at runtime with an environment variable,
which is handy when one laptop's adapter is named differently:

    set NSA_TARGET_NETWORK=192.168.137.0/24
    set NSA_CAPTURE_INTERFACE=Wi-Fi
