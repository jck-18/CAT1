# Network Security Assessment

A local network security assessment built for a mid-sem group project (40 marks, 4 phases). Python orchestrates Nmap and Wireshark/TShark to discover hosts and capture and analyze traffic, spoofs a MAC via the Windows registry, and produces a hardening report.

## Who owns what

| Folder | Owner | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `phase1_discovery/` | Member 1 | Network discovery & port scanning (Nmap) |
| `phase2_capture/` | Member 2 | Packet capture & analysis (Wireshark/PyShark) |
| `phase3_spoofing/` | Member 3 | MAC spoofing (registry + adapter restart, automated) |
| `phase4_analysis/` | Member 3 | Security analysis & reporting |
| `shared/` | All | Config, setup, shared helpers |

## Getting started

1. **Everyone:** clone the repo, then follow `shared/SETUP.md` (get all three laptops on the same network, note each host's IP, install Python).
2. **Then:** go to your own phase folder and follow its `README.md` for tool installs and run instructions. You don't need to install tools for phases you don't own.
3. Fill in your host IPs and interface names in `shared/config.py`.

## How the pieces connect

Phases 1 and 2 run in parallel and write their results into their `outputs/` folders. Phase 4 reads those results and produces the final report + charts. See `CLAUDE.md` for the data formats each phase must produce.

```
phase1_discovery/outputs/hosts.json  ----+
phase2_capture/outputs/packets.csv       |
phase2_capture/outputs/protocol_stats.json --> phase4_analysis --> report.xlsx
phase3_spoofing/outputs/mac_log.json ----+                        + charts
```

## Commands, per phase

```bash
python phase1_discovery/scan.py                    # discover + port scan
python phase2_capture/capture.py --duration 60 --generate-traffic
python phase2_capture/analyze.py                   # pcap -> csv + stats
python phase3_spoofing/mac_control.py demo         # guided spoof + restore
python phase4_analysis/analyze_security.py         # findings
python phase4_analysis/report.py                   # charts + report.xlsx
```

Member 3 is not blocked waiting for the others — `analyze_security.py --sample` runs the whole Phase 4 chain against synthetic data so the report and slide template can be built before Phases 1 and 2 deliver.

Check your effective network config any time with:

```bash
python shared/config.py
```

## A note on `outputs/`

Generated evidence is gitignored: pcaps are large and contain your own browsing traffic. When you need to hand a result to Member 3, force-add just that file:

```bash
git add -f phase1_discovery/outputs/hosts.json
```

## Working agreement

- Each phase writes only to its own `outputs/`.
- Don't hardcode IPs or interface names — put them in `shared/config.py`.
- Run every tool manually once before automating it. The presentation depends on understanding the output, not just producing it.

## Scope

This assesses the team's own three laptops on their own network only.
