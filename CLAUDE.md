# CLAUDE.md — Network Security Assessment (Mid-Sem Project)

This file is the standing context for this project. Read it at the start of every session.

## What this project is

A hands-on **local network security assessment** for a mid-sem assessment (40 marks, 4 phases × 10, **must be presented**). We play the role of assessors auditing a small network, then recommend how to harden it. The four phases follow a real security-assessment workflow: recon → traffic analysis → identity spoofing → synthesis.

## Team & environment

- **3-person group**, 3 Windows laptops, all on the **same network** (one WiFi/hotspot or switch). Each laptop is both a host to be discovered and a working node.
- OS: Windows (Phase 3's registry-based MAC spoof is Windows-only — this is fine).
- Everyone clones the whole repo but works only in their own phase folder.

## Tech stack

Python is the orchestration layer over industry-standard tools. Wrap, don't reinvent.

| Purpose | Tool / library |
|---|---|
| Network scanning | Nmap, driven by `python-nmap` |
| Packet capture | Wireshark / TShark |
| Packet analysis | `pyshark` (parses `.pcap`) |
| MAC spoofing | Windows registry (`NetworkAddress` override) + adapter restart, via `subprocess`/`winreg` — no external tool |
| Data / reporting | `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `openpyxl` |
| (optional) traffic gen | `scapy` |

## Roles & ownership

- **Member 1 — Discovery & Scanning (Phase 1):** Nmap host discovery, OS detection, TCP port scan, service + version detection. Owns `phase1_discovery/`. Deliverable: table of active hosts → IPs → open ports → services → OS.
- **Member 2 — Capture & Analysis (Phase 2):** Generate traffic (browse, download, DNS lookup, ping) while capturing; parse the pcap for src/dst IP, protocol, packet length, TCP three-way handshake, DNS lookup. Owns `phase2_capture/`.
- **Member 3 — Privacy + Security Analysis + Reporting (Phases 3 & 4):** automated MAC spoofing demo (view → spoof via registry + restart → verify → restore), no manual tool to click through; then synthesize Phase 1 + 2 outputs into open-port/insecure-protocol findings, firewall rules, hardening recs; owns the reporting layer and slide consolidation. Owns `phase3_spoofing/` and `phase4_analysis/`.

## Sequencing / dependencies

- Phases 1 and 2 run in parallel and **produce data**.
- Phase 4 **consumes** Phase 1 + Phase 2 outputs, so it lands last. Member 3 is not idle meanwhile — the Phase 3 spoof, the reporting scaffold, and slide template can all be built in parallel.
- Shared `SETUP.md` is a hard prerequisite for everyone.

## Data contract (so phases interoperate)

Keep these stable so Phase 4 can consume Phases 1 & 2 without rework.

- **Phase 1 → `phase1_discovery/outputs/hosts.json`**: list of
  `{ ip, hostname, mac, os, ports: [ { port, protocol, service, version, state } ] }`
- **Phase 2 → `phase2_capture/outputs/packets.csv`**: one row per packet:
  `timestamp, src_ip, dst_ip, protocol, length, info`
  plus `protocol_stats.json` with per-protocol counts and the identified TCP handshake / DNS lookup examples.
- **Phase 4** reads both, writes `report.xlsx` + charts.

## Conventions

- Each phase writes only to its own `outputs/`.
- Each phase folder has a self-contained `README.md`: what to install, how to run, what it produces.
- Network specifics (host IPs, interface name) live in `shared/config.py` — don't hardcode elsewhere.

## Presentation cohesion trick

Have Member 3 run the automated spoof (`python phase3_spoofing/mac_control.py demo`), then Member 1 re-run Nmap host discovery live — the laptop reappears with a different MAC. Because the spoof is scripted (registry write + adapter restart, no GUI to click through), the whole cycle takes seconds and nothing can go wrong mid-click in front of the room. This visually links Phase 3 back to Phase 1 and makes the whole thing read as one system.

## Working loop per phase

Understand the concept → run it manually so you see what's happening → automate it in Python. Don't skip the manual run; the presentation depends on the team actually understanding the output.

## Scope / ethics

Everything targets the team's own three laptops on their own network. State this explicitly in the report — Phase 4 is literally about auditing a network you're responsible for.
